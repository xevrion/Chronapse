# Chronapse
  
**Capture time. Compress moments. Command the lapse.**  

Chronapse is a Linux-only timelapse recorder that blends the elegance of Go’s [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) TUI with the simplicity of Python and OpenCV.  
It lets you record long-duration timelapses directly from your laptop camera — efficiently, safely, and beautifully.
